Jana is a PhD student in the Velten lab who completed her bachelor's degree in "Molecular Biotechnology" at Heidelberg University and later pursued her master's studies in "Biomathematics" at the University of Greifswald. For her master's thesis, she spent six months in Boston working on the coupling of gene expression and chromatin dynamics during aging with Prof. Caroline Uhler at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

In her PhD project, Jana develops probabilistic machine learning tools to analyze single-cell CRISPR screens. Her research aims to enhance the understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms by identifying causal relationships between genes, with a particular focus on determining the perturbation state of each cell.

Outside of work, Jana enjoys outdoor activities such as running, hiking, and swimming. Additionally, she likes playing board games or cooking and baking with friends.
