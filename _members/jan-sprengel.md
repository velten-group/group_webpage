Jan is a master student in the Velten lab. He completed his bachelor's degree in physics with work in Computational Genomics at the Kirchoff Institute for Physics in Heidelberg. Currently he is pursuing the master's degree in physics with emphasis on computational and statistical Physics.

In his master's thesis Jan is working with Machine-Learning-based Causal Inference methods which make use of single-cell RNA transcription data including targeted interventions. The hope is that these will help study gene regulatory networks in cells and gain further insight into the complex biological processes taking place.

Apart from his studies, he enjoys outdoor activities including running and climbing. He also likes to do photography or to read a good book.
